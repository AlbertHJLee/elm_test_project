# Elm test projects

This repo is a collection of mini projects for testing and learning how Elm works.

The majority of scripts in the src folder are built off of the [official Elm examples](https://elm-lang.org/examples),
with modifications based on the learning exercises in [The Official Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/).

Two of the scripts have substantial development beyond what is provided in the Elm
examples, and these are probably the most interesting ones in the repo, at least for
people who have completed the examples in The Official Guide:

  1. [Magnet.elm](src/Magnet.elm) is a simple design with interactive elements.
  2. [Animatic.elm](src/Animatic.elm) is a mockup of an educational webapp that
  can transition through a sequence of animated scenes.

**NOTE:** the files circles.html and animatic.html have been slightly modified
from the version you would get by directly compiling from Magnet.elm and
Animatic.elm, respectively.
